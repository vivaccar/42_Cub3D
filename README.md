# Cub3D

## Introduction
The Cub3D project at 42 is an introduction to 3D graphics development using the technique of raycasting. The goal is to create a first-person game similar to the classic Wolfenstein 3D, where the player navigates through a maze and views the environment in a 3D perspective, even though the map is represented as a 2D grid. This project provides a practical way to learn the fundamentals of 3D rendering and graphics manipulation using MiniLibX, a small graphical library provided by the school. The implementation involves setting up a raycasting system that simulates the 3D effect by casting rays from the player's position to detect walls and render them accordingly.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Library**: MiniLibX (provided by the 42 school)
- **Ambient**: Linux.

## Map Configuration

The program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the `.cub` extension. This file describes the map and the various elements needed for the game to function properly.

### Map Composition
- The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters:
  - `0` for an empty space.
  - `1` for a wall.
  - `N, S, E, W` for the playerâ€™s start position and orientation (North, South, East, or West).

- Example of a simple valid map:
```bash
1111111111
1001000001
1010000011
1100N00111
1111111111
```

### Map Requirements
- The map must be **closed** or **surrounded by walls** (`1`). If the map is not properly enclosed, the program must return an error.
- Except for the map content (which is always the last element), each type of information can be separated by one or more empty lines.
- Each type of element, except for the map, can be placed in any order in the file.
- Each element (except the map) begins with an identifier, followed by the relevant information for that element. These identifiers and their details are listed below:

### Elements and Identifiers
1. **Textures**: Textures for each direction (North, South, East, and West) are specified as follows:
 - North Texture:
   ```
   NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
   ```
   - Identifier: `NO`
   - Path: Path to the north texture file.

 - South Texture:
   ```
   SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
   ```
   - Identifier: `SO`
   - Path: Path to the south texture file.

 - West Texture:
   ```
   WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
   ```
   - Identifier: `WE`
   - Path: Path to the west texture file.

 - East Texture:
   ```
   EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
   ```
   - Identifier: `EA`
   - Path: Path to the east texture file.

2. **Colors**: Floor and ceiling colors are defined using RGB values in the range `[0,255]`:
 - Floor Color:
   ```
   F 220,100,0
   ```
   - Identifier: `F`
   - RGB Values: `220, 100, 0`

 - Ceiling Color:
   ```
   C 225,30,0
   ```
   - Identifier: `C`
   - RGB Values: `225, 30, 0`
